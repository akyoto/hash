Currently abandoned in favor of https://github.com/zeebo/xxh3, an XXH3 port for Go that I didn't know about until recently.
It is superior to the old algorithm included in this repository, which is why I will leave the existing interface as
wrapper functions to the library mentioned above. Please help the XXH3 port instead.
